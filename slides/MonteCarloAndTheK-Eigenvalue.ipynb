    "### Problem 1 - RANDU \n",
    "\n",
    "RANDU is an infamous multiplicative linear congruential pseudorandom number generator which\n",
    "has been used since the 1960â€™s with parameters: $g = 65539$, $m = 31$, $c = 0$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Implement this LCG, and use this to plot a 1-D, 2-D and 3-D distribution of many randomly selected points using an initial seed of 1. A 2-D point, as an example, is formed by a pair of consecutive random numbers.  Discuss your findings.\n",
    "  - Find at least one historical reference in the literature for RANDU and report on what you learn.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Problem 2 - The Slab\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a slab of width 10 cm.  Solve the time-independent, monoenergetic, transport equation for this slab assuming it consists of a purely absorbing medium having an absorption cross section $\\Sigma_a$ 1/cm.  Assume further that the slab is filled with an isotropic source $s(x, \\mu) = \\frac{s}{2}$ for $x\\in [0, W/2]$ (with no source in the other half).  Determine the average value of $\\phi$ in each of 10, evenly-spaced regions (i.e., divide the geometry into 10, 1-cm cells and tally the flux in each).  Use any flux estimator you want, but include uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3 - The  Slab Reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, assume a 10 cm, homogeneous slab with $\\Sigma_t = 1.2$, $\\Sigma_s = 0.6$, and $\\nu\\Sigma_f = 0.7$.  Determine the $k$ eigenvalue of this reactor and compare to what you might expect using NE 630-level diffusion theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, use any flux estimator you wish to compute the critical flux in each of 10, 1-cm regions (like in problem 2)."
